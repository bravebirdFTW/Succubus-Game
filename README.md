# Succubus Game (Ren'Py Visual Novel)

A narrative-driven visual novel prototype created in **Ren'Py**, featuring custom art, dialogue systems, and branching story paths.

## 🕹️ About the Project
This project began as a personal experiment to learn narrative scripting, UI design, and event-driven logic within Ren'Py.  
It combines visual storytelling with interactive choices that influence character relationships and outcomes.

**Note:** This demo includes mild suggestive themes and supernatural elements presented for story context, not explicit content.  
It is intended as a creative writing and art project rather than an adult game.

## 🧠 Features
- Branching dialogue system with persistent variables  
- Original **character, background, and UI art** fully designed and illustrated by me  
- Multiple endings based on player decisions  
- Custom menu interface and animated transitions  
- Save/load system and event triggers

## 🎨 Art & Design
All visual assets — including character sprites, environments, and UI elements — were drawn in **Clip Studio Paint** and implemented directly into the Ren'Py engine.  
This allowed full control over the aesthetic direction and visual storytelling.

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Engine:** Ren'Py (Python)  
- **Art Tools:** Clip Studio Paint  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  


## 📚 Learning Focus
This project was built to strengthen:
- Python scripting and logic design  
- Structuring branching narrative systems  
- Integrating custom art pipelines into a game engine  
- Managing assets and state persistence  
- Publishing and documenting creative projects through GitHub
